# Will it rain today?

## Part 1

Demo web app to demonstrate how to use Service Worker.

https://will-it-rain-today-c287a.firebaseapp.com/

> This repo accompanies a two-part tutorial written for *net magazine*

In this two-part tutorial we’re going to show you how to progressively enhance
your site or webapp with a Service Worker to give you faster loading times and
offline support.

In part 1 we’re going to learn about Service Worker registration and set up a
bare bones worker that will cache and serve our static assets, delivering a
huge performance boost on subsequent loads.

Next month, in part 2, we’ll learn how to cache dynamic API responses and give
our demo app full offline support.

The `master` branch contains the starting point.

The `tutorial` branch contains the completed tutorial. With each step flagged
with a *tag*. See below for more info.
